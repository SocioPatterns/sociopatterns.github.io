The wearable proximity sensors of the SocioPatterns collaborations have been deployed at the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Concordia/Welcome_to_Concordia2" target="_blank">Concordia Base</a>, the French-Italian research station in Antarctica. Data from the sensors will be used to quantify social interactions networks in the context of a series of studies on team performance and health duering long-term isolation. This is a collaboration with the University of Bern (Prof. Andrea Cantisani), ETH Zurich (Prof. Jan Schmutz), and the Universidade Lusófona (Prof. Pedro Marques-Quinteiro).
