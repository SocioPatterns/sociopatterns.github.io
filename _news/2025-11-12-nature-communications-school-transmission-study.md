We have published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66719-3">new paper in Nature Communications</a> that combines virological, proximity, and environmental data to study respiratory virus transmission in schools. This six-week longitudinal study in a Swiss secondary school represents the first integration of these three data types to assess their relative contributions to disease spread.

The study tracked 67 students aged 14-15, detecting 87 infections through saliva samples while simultaneously measuring close-proximity contacts with wearable sensors and air quality via CO2 monitors. Genomic analysis was used to exclude implausible transmission pairs. The results show that time spent in shared, poorly ventilated classrooms was a stronger predictor of transmission than time spent in close proximity to infected individuals. This suggests that prolonged exposure in shared spaces with potentially multiple infectious sources drives respiratory virus transmission more than direct close contact, with implications for school ventilation policies and mitigation strategies.
