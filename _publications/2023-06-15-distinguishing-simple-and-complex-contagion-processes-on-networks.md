 Contagion processes on networks, including disease spreading, information diffusion, or social behaviors propagation, can be modeled as simple contagion, i.e., as a contagion process involving one connection at a time, or as complex contagion, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event. Empirical data on spreading processes, however, even when available, do not easily allow us to uncover which of these underlying contagion mechanisms is at work. We propose a strategy to discriminate between these mechanisms upon the observation of a single instance of a spreading process. The strategy is based on the observation of the order in which network nodes are infected, and on its correlations with their local topology: these correlations differ between processes of simple contagion, processes involving threshold mechanisms, and processes driven by group interactions (i.e., by “higher-order” mechanisms). Our results improve our understanding of contagion processes and provide a method using only limited information to distinguish between several possible contagion mechanisms.
