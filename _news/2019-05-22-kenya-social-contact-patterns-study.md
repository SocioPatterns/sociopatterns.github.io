We have published a <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-84">study protocol in Wellcome Open Research</a> describing new data collection efforts in Kenya. In collaboration with researchers at KEMRI-Wellcome Trust and the University of Warwick, we are deploying proximity sensors in two schools (one rural, one urban) and in associated households in Kilifi County, Kenya.

This marks the first application of the SocioPatterns measurement approach in sub-Saharan Africa. Each deployment will involve up to 350 participants wearing wireless proximity sensors for 7 consecutive days to capture face-to-face contact patterns. The resulting data will characterize contact patterns that shape respiratory infection transmission in previously unstudied populations and settings, and will be used to parameterize mathematical simulation models of transmission for respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus.
